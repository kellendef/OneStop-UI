# This application was created with create-react-app. 
It functions as a ui to allow customers to place food orders. Using the fetch api, the application calls an api written in fastify to retrieve menu contents, allow the creation of an order, and submits the order for processing. 

# The application is still very much a work in progress. Instructions will be added soon. 
This app uses an api I am running and testing locally. I am doing my best to ensure everything works as intended, then will create instructions and begin refactoring and fixing the application. To run the ui (which should display an error message to the user, as the api call will fail) use the "npm start" command from the create-react-app scripts.
